            The 1970s is know for it colors and eleborate patterns. Fashion in the decade was all about individuality. To quote Vogue, "There [were] no rules in the fshion game." Top models were beginning to be recognized as 'supermodels.' Fashion designers and models defined many aspects of the 1970s

        <h3>“Feminist Fashion” in the 1970s<br></h2>
            <p>
                <strong><em>What is feminist fashion?</em></strong><br>
                
                Feminist fashion is an extention of the feminist movement. It is meant to teach women that they can dress however they want regardless of society's opinion. Feminist fashion has been around since the beginning of the feminist movement and is still being used today to fight for gender equality. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                <strong><em>Why was it needed in the 70s?</em></strong><br>
                
                The 1970s were at the beginning of women in the workforce. During this time, women were expected to act passive and supportive in the workplace. Men had already been in control for so long and women wanted to take some of that power regardless of men's thoughts on the matter. Women were given less power, pay and opportunities. Feminists during this time planned to use fashion to try and get what they thought they deserved.
            </p>
            <p>   
                <strong><em>How was it used?</em></strong><br>
                
                Women refused to wear what was advertised at the time, thus starting the trend of women wearing what they want and not what society expects. However, this mindset and sense of individuality did not fully extend to the male dominated workplaces due to the dress codes in place. If women broke the set dress codes too severely they were at risk of being fired, which meant they had to express themselves within the confines of these rules. If these rules did not exist, feminists would have encouraged women to wear pants and clothing with pockets. These items were only worn by men at the time, meaning if women were to wear these it would blur the line between the sexes. However, since women still valued their jobs and did not want to risk their careers, they chose to wear skirt suits and feminine pants. Despite these pants still being worn with feminine tops, the mere fact they were wearing them caused some waves in the workplace. 
            </p>
            <p>   
                <strong><em>How does this impact today?</em></strong><br>
                
                Even though gender equality still has a long way to go, we would not have come this far if it were not for the work of the past. If it were not for the work of women in the 1970s and other decades, women now may still be expected to be submissive to men in the workplace.
