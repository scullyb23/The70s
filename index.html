        <h1>The 70s: A Teen's View</h1>
        <p>

            <strong><em>What did you wear in the 70s?</em></strong><br>

            In the seventies, I was in junior high school and then high school at the time. So most of my clothes were casual clothes such as blue jeans and sneakers. But one thing I remember most were the wide collar Quiana, shiney polyester, shirts me and my friends used to wear to school. If we wanted to look extra dressy but casual to school, we would wear the polyester shirts with Levi's corduroy pants. The final part of what almost every teenage boy wore in those days were either Member's Only jackets or Barracuda golf jackets with the collar flipped up.

            <strong><em>Who were your fashion inspirations as a teen?</em></strong><br>

            As a teenager, most of my fashion choices were probably inspired by rock stars and TV show actors. For me, shows like Starsky & Hutch, Six Million Dollar Man, and Charlie's Angels probably showed me how a guy should dress.

            <strong><em>Who were some of your favorite artists?</em></strong><br>

            The rock Stars I followed the most were the Rolling Stones and the Who at the start of the 70's. By the time the second half of the 70's rolled along, I was following Bruce Sprinsteen, David Bowie, Fleetwood Mac and probably dozens of “one hit wonders.”

            <strong><em>Do you believe the 70s can be defined by one genre? Why?</em></strong><br>

            No, the 70's really cannot be defined by one genre, as much as people like to think so, with the Avocado green and Harvest orange color schemes and the overall terrible style choices. The 70's went along so quickly starting out from the serious events and issues from the Sixties. But the Vietnam War, Watergate, the Me Generation attitude, etc put people on a far-flung ride of self-discovery and self-involvement that the anti-War movement and hippies at the start of the decade almost seemed quaint by the end of the Seventies to the drugged out masses trying to get into the latest disco. People went off in a million different directions at once. People thought the Sixties were chaotic, but in the direct lives of everyday people, the Seventies were when many of my friends' parents were divorcing, people were experimenting with more than just marijauna, people followed wide ranges of musical tastes from rock to easy listening to disco to R&B, etc.
